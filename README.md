# 0-shell

**0-shell** is a minimalist Unix-like shell implemented in **Rust** as an educational project. It demonstrates basic shell functionality and system-level programming in Rust.

---

## üìù Overview

0-shell is a simple shell that allows executing basic commands in a Unix-like environment. It focuses on core functionality and is designed for learning and experimentation.  

This project helped me understand **how shells work**, **command parsing**, and **process management** in Rust.

---

## ‚ö° Features

- Written in **Rust**.
- Supports basic commands:
  - `echo`, `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, `touch`, `exit`
- Lightweight and easy to extend.
- Educational: shows how a shell works under the hood using Rust‚Äôs system APIs.

## üíª Installation & Run Command

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0-shell.git
cd 0-shell
cargo run
```

## üéØ Purpose

This project was completed as part of my educational journey in system programming with Rust. It demonstrates:

- Understanding the behavior and architecture of Unix-like shells.
- Implementing command parsing and execution.
- Working directly with system-level APIs in Rust.
- Strengthening practical Rust programming and problem-solving skills, making it a strong example to showcase on a CV.
